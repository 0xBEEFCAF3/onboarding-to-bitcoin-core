== Mempool terminology

Ancestor(s):: One or more "parent" transactions which must be confirmed **before** the current transaction. +
The ancestor transaction(s) _create_ outputs which are depended on by the current transaction.
Descendant(s):: One or more "child" transactions which must be confirmed **after** the current transaction. +
The descendant transaction(s) _depend_ on outputs from the current transaction.
Orphan:: A transaction with missing ancestors.

TIP: When _ancestor_ and _descendant_ are encountered in the codebase, they refer specifically to other **in-mempool** transactions.

TIP: Ancestors and descendants can be confirmed in the same block but they must be in the correct order within the list of `transactions` for the block to be valid.

With bitcoin we are seeking to create a permissionless network in which anyone can make a bitcoin transaction.
Anybody should be free and able to run a node and join the network.

The Bitcoin P2P network serves 3 purposes:

* <<{address-relay}address_relay, Gossiping addresses>> of known reachable nodes on the network
* <<{transaction-relay}transaction_relay, Relaying unconfirmed transactions>>
* <<{block-relay}block_relay, Propagating blocks>>

Although these three purposes share the same network, they have different design goals and properties. 
Transaction relay is optimized for a combination of redundancy/robustness to peer misbehaviour as well as bandwidth minimization, while block relay is optimized to minimize delay.

== Threads

The `main()` function starts the main bitcoind process thread, usefully named `bitcoind`.
All subsequent threads are currently started as children of the `bitcoind` thread, although this is not an explicit design requirement.

The Bitcoin Core Developer https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#threads=[docs^] contains a section on threads, which is summarised below in two tables, one for net threads, and one for other threads.

.Non-net threads
[%autowidth]
|===
|Name |Function |Description

|`bitcoind`
|`main()`
|Responsible for starting up and shutting down the application, and spawning all sub-threads

|`b-loadblk`
|`ThreadImport`
|Loads blocks from `blk*.dat` files or `-loadblock=<file>` on startup

|`b-scriptch.x`
|`ThreadScriptCheck`
|Parallel script validation threads for transactions in blocks

|`b-http`
|`ThreadHTTP`
|Libevent thread to listen for RPC and REST connections

|`b-httpworker.x`
|`StartHTTPServer`
|HTTP worker threads. Threads to service RPC and REST requests

|`b-txindex.x`
|`ThreadSync`
|Indexer threads. One thread per indexer

|`b-scheduler`
|`SchedulerThread`
|Does asynchronous background tasks like dumping wallet contents, dumping `addrman` and running asynchronous `validationinterface` callbacks

|`b-torcontrol`
|`TorControlThread`
|Libevent thread for tor connections

=== Net threads

.Net threads
[%autowidth]
|===
|Name |Function |Description

|`b-msghand`
|`ThreadMessageHandler`
|Application level message handling (sending and receiving). Almost all `net_processing` and validation logic runs on this thread

|`b-dnsseed`
|`ThreadDNSAddressSeed`
|Loads addresses of peers from the `ThreadDNS`

|`b-upnp`
|`ThreadMapPort`
|Universal plug-and-play startup/shutdown

|`b-net`
|`ThreadSocketHandler`
|Sends/Receives data from peers on port 8333

|`b-addcon`
|`ThreadOpenAddedConnections`
|Opens network connections to added nodes

|`b-opencon`
|`ThreadOpenConnections`
|Initiates new connections to peers

|`b-i2paccept`
|`ThreadI2PAcceptIncoming`
|Listens for and accepts incoming I2P connections through the I2P SAM proxy

=== Thread debugging

In order to debug a multi-threaded application like bitcoind using gdb you will need to enable following child processes.
Below is shown the contents of a file `threads.brk` which can be sourced into gdb using `source threads.brk`, before you start debugging bitcoind.
The file also loads break points where new threads are spawned.

.threads.brk
[source,bash]

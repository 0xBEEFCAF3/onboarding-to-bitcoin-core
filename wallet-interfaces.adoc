=== Wallet interfaces

include::tmp/links.adoc[]

In order to facilitate code separation, distinct interfaces between the node and the wallet have been created:

* The node holds a https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v23.0/src/wallet/interfaces.cpp#L114[`WalletImpl`^] interface to call functions on the wallet.
* The wallet holds a https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v23.0/src/node/interfaces.cpp#L452[`ChainImpl`^] interface to call functions on the node.
* The node notifies the wallet about new transactions and blocks through the https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v23.0/src/node/interfaces.cpp#L364[`CValidationInterface`^].

TIP: For more information on `*Impl` classes see <<{appendix}pimpl-technique,PIMPL technique>> in the appendix.

_Ensuring that Bitcoin Core remains highly secure software requires
reviewers and maintainers scrutinize every contribution, no matter how
minor it seems.  The best way to avoid wasting the time of reviewers and
risking having them ignore your contribution is to read the entire
onboarding guide, as described on the [main page](/).  However, if
you're going to contribute anyway without reading all of the
documentation, this quickstart will guide you to the most relevant parts
of the contributor documentation._

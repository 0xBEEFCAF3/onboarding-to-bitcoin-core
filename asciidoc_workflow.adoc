= Use of asciidoc in the documentation

The https://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoc] format has been used for this documentation.

To use asciidoc format, ensure that the `asciidoctor` tool is installed (and on your system $PATH).
Also, it can be useful to ensure your editor understands the filetype, e.g. for Vim you can install https://github.com/habamax/vim-asciidoctor[vim-asciidoctor].

== Generating index.html for static hosting

You can generate an _index.html_ file for static web hosting by installing `asciidoctor` and then running:

[source,bash]
----
asciidoctor index.adoc
----

=== Reduce as a pre-commit hook

If you prefer you can write a simple pre-commit hook to generate an updated _index.adoc_ file at each commit.
An example of this might be:

.$PROJECT_ROOT/.git/hooks/pre-commit
[source,text]
----
#!/bin/sh

asciidoctor index.adoc
----

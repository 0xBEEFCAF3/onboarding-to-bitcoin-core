== Script origins

. New scripts are created when creating a new address.
. Scripts can be learned about when we receive a new transaction from the P2P network or from a newly-connected block.
. With Taproot there may be scripts in alternative Tapscript execution paths which nobody on the network will ever learn about.

== Scripts in Bitcoin Core

The primary script objects are found in _script.h_.
An enum over all the permitted OPCODES, `enum opcodetype`.
The `CScriptNum` class which handles arithmetic operations on integer ``CScriptNum``s, whether from a loose `int_64t` or from a second `CScriptNum` object.
The `CScript` class which supports serializing data into scripts, along with many helper functions such as returning the script type.

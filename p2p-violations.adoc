== P2P violations

Bitcoin Core has several options for how to treat peers that violate the rules of the P2P protocol:

. Ignore the individual message, but continue processing other messages from that peer
. Increment the peer's "misbehaviour" score, and punish the peer once its score goes above a certain amount
. Disconnect from the peer
. Disconnect from the peer and prevent any later connections from that peer's address (discouragement)

Since https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20079[PR#20079^] we now treat handshake misbehaviour like an unknown message

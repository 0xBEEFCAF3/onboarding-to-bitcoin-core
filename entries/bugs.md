# Quickstart: fixing bugs

{% include best-way.md %}

In this guide, we assume that you think you've discovered a bug.  You
may want to immediately report the bug, or you may want to begin
debugging and fixing it yourself.

- To report an issue:

  - You may want to quickly [mention](/comms.html) the behavior you
    think is a bug in chat to confirm it's unexpected behavior.

  - You should get [set up with GitHub](/github.html) to submit an
    issue.

- To debug an issue:

  - You will need to [build Bitcoin
    Core](/building.html) optionally with [debugging
    options](/debugging.html).

  - You may want to [write a test](/testing.html) that demonstrates your
    bug and will prove it's been fixed.

  - If you need certain network activity to reproduce your bug, you can
    test on [test networks](/testnets.html).

  - If you're trying to find a particular file, learn about Bitcoin
    Core's [architecture](/architecture.html).

  - If you begin to suspect that your "bug" might be deliberate
    behavior, research the [history of particular
    code](/past-changes.html).

- To contribute a change:

  - Follow project [guidelines](/contributing.html) for effective
    commits and GitHub PRs.

  - Understand the jargon and process other developers will use in
    [evaluating](/pr-maturation.html) your proposed change.

  - Optionally help [review](/reviewing.html) contributions from other
    developers to encourage them to review your contribution.

Many other parts of the contributing guide can help explain how to
successfully debug, report, and fix a bug.  If you find yourself stymied
at any point, or just curious about Bitcoin Core, please consider
reading the full documentation starting from the [main page](/).

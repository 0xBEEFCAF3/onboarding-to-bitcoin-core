== Consensus in Bitcoin Core

Naturally one might assume that all code related to consensus could be found in the _src/consensus/_ directory, however this is not entirely the case.
Components of consensus-related code can be found across the Bitcoin Core codebase in a number of files, including but not limited to:

[#consensus-components,listing]
----
ðŸ“‚ bitcoin
  ðŸ“‚ src
    ðŸ“‚ consensus
    ðŸ“‚ script
      ðŸ“„interpreter.cpp
    ðŸ“„ validation.h
    ðŸ“„ validation.cpp
----

Consensus-critical functions can also be found in proximity to code which could affect whether a node considers a transaction or block valid.
This could extend to, for example, block storage xref:consensus-bugs.adoc#database_consensus[database] code.

An abbreviated list of some of the more notable consensus functions and variables is shown below.

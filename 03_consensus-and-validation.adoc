// == Removed text
//
// The outline of the mechanism at work is that a node relaying a transaction can slightly modify the signature in a way which is still acceptable to the underlying OpenSSL module.
// Once the signature has been changed, the transaction ID (hash) will also change.
// If the modified transaction is then included in a block, before the original, the effect is that the sender will still see the outgoing transaction as "unconfirmed" in their wallet.
// The sender wallet should however also see the accepted (modified) outgoing transaction, so their balance will be calculated correctly, only a "stuck doublespend" will pollute their wallet.
// The receiver will not perceive anything unordinary, unless they were tracking the incoming payment using the txid as given to them by the sender.

== Consensus vs Policy

What is the difference between consensus and policy checks?
Both seem to be related to validating transactions.
We can learn a lot about the answer to this question from sdaftuar's StackExchange https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/100317/what-is-the-difference-between-policy-and-consensus-when-it-comes-to-a-bitcoin-c/100319#100319[answer^].

The answer teaches us that policy checks are a superset of validation checks --  that is to say that a transaction that passes policy checks has implicitly passed consensus checks too.
Nodes perform policy-level checks on all transactions they learn about before adding them to their local mempool.
Many of the policy checks contained in `policy` are called from inside `validation`, in the context of adding a new transaction to the mempool.

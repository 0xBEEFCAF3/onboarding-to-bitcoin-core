== P2P message encryption

P2P messages are currently all unencrypted which can potentially open up vulnerabilities like:

* Associated metadata in P2P messages may reveal private information.
* Possibilities for attackers who control the routing infrastructure of the P2P network to censor P2P
messages since P2P messages can be detected trivially - they always start with a fixed sequence of magic bytes.

https://gist.github.com/dhruv/5b1275751bc98f3b64bcafce7876b489[BIP 324^] proposes a new Bitcoin P2P protocol which features transport encryption and slightly lower bandwidth usage.

https://bip324.com[bip324.com^] contains a list of all the open PRs and great resources to understand the proposal.
A visual explanation of how BIP 324 works can be found in this blog - https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/bip324.md[How to encrypt the P2P protocol?^]
